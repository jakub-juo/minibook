  <h2>How to begin your quest</h2>
  <p>
    Are you ready for an amazing adventure &mdash; with twists and turns, exciting action and puzzles to solve? Then this book is for you!
  </p>
  <p>
    The Improbable School is no ordinary book &mdash; you don't read the pages in order, 1, 2, 3... Instead you must jump to and fro, forwards and back, as the plot unfolds. Sometimes you may lose your way, but the story will soon guide you back to where you need to be.
  </p>
  <p>
    The story begins on page 3. Very soon you will have problems to solve and choices to make. The choices will look something like this:
  </p>
  <ul class="choices">
    <li><a>If you think the correct answer is A, go to page 1 🐢</a></li>
    <li><a>If you think the correct answer is B, go to page 2 🕵️</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Your task is to solve each problem and make the right choice. So, if you think the correct answer is A, you turn to page 1 and look for the 🐢 symbol. That's where you will find the next part of the story.
  </p>
  <p>
    But what happens if you make the wrong choice? Don't worry! The text will explain where you went wrong and send you back to try again.
  </p>
  <p>
    The problems in this adventure are all about measuring uncertainty. There's some uncertainty in everything we ever perceive, think, say and do. Hardly anything is absolutely certain, or perhaps nothing ever is. That fact itself is uncertain. The best we can do is recognize that uncertainty can be measured, and some things are way more or way less probable than others.

  <p>
    Waving your hands gently, you herd the little guy toward the open tunnel. He hesitates — but the chaos in the room behind him is growing. A loud bang sends him bolting into the "safe" tunnel!
  </p>
  <p>
    Victory! You lean down and gently lift him into your hands, where he snuggles, trembling but safe.
  </p>
  <ul class="choices">

<article id="door" class="story-step">
  <span class="step-marker">🚪</span>
  <p>
    You bolt after the hamster as he heads toward the door. Just as you reach it, he squeezes through the narrow crack at the bottom. You yank the door open and follow.
  </p>
  <p>
    Outside, the hallway stretches ahead. Lockers, coats, and lunch smells. Where did he go?
  </p>
  <ul class="choices">
    <li><a href="#listen">Listen carefully for tiny footsteps 👂</a></li>

<article id="catch" class="story-step">
  <span class="step-marker">🎯</span>
  <p>
    You dive once more, arms stretched wide. This time, you're ready. You trap him gently against the floor using your sweater, scooping him up safely inside it.
  </p>
  <p>
    The classroom erupts into applause! Even Mr. Lennox gives a tired but grateful thumbs up.

<article id="cafeteria" class="story-step">
  <span class="step-marker">🍽️</span>
  <p>
    The cafeteria is a war zone of smells and clattering trays. You spot the hamster weaving between tables and backpacks.
  </p>
  <p>
    Miss Jenna, the lunch lady, shrieks as he nearly runs across the dessert counter. "Is that a RAT?!" she yells. Chaos erupts.
  </p>

</article>

<article id="shortcut" class="story-step">
  <span class="step-marker">🗺️</span>
  <p>
    Thinking fast, you take the shortcut through the art room. You dodge paint buckets and easels, making it to the other cafeteria entrance just as the hamster barrels through.
  </p>
  <p>
    Perfect! You crouch low, ready to intercept.
  </p>

<article id="nest" class="story-step">
  <span class="step-marker">🛏️</span>
  <p>
    You pile towels into a soft little nest near the lockers and sprinkle a few cracker crumbs inside.
  </p>
  <p>
    The hamster, curious, sniffs his way over. With a little happy hop, he burrows deep into the pile. You gently fold the towels around him, creating a cozy, portable hamster burrito.
  </p>

    <li><a href="#nurse-office">Bring him to the nurse's office 🚑</a></li>
    <li><a href="#backpack-hideout">Hide him safely in your backpack 🎒</a></li>

</article>

<article id="locker-hide" class="story-step">
  <span class="step-marker">👀</span>
  <p>
    You hide behind the lockers, holding your breath. Sure enough, the hamster comes sniffing along, looking for safety.
  </p>
  <p>
    You pounce — carefully — and catch him with both hands! He looks up at you, tiny nose twitching, and doesn't even try to wriggle away.
