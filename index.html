    You crouch down, still as a statue. Minutes feel like hours. Slowly, the hamster noses toward your improvised tunnel. His whiskers twitch. His tiny paws patter closer.
  </p>
  <p>
    You stay patient — painfully patient — and finally, finally, he scurries into the passageway. In a single smooth move, you tip a book to block the exit and scoop him up gently.
  </p>

  <span class="step-marker">👋</span>
  <p>
    Waving your hands gently, you herd the little guy toward the open tunnel. He hesitates — but the chaos in the room behind him is growing. A loud bang sends him bolting into the "safe" tunnel!
  </p>
  <p>
    Victory! You lean down and gently lift him into your hands, where he snuggles, trembling but safe.

<article id="door" class="story-step">
  <span class="step-marker">🚪</span>
  <p>
    You bolt after the hamster as he heads toward the door. Just as you reach it, he squeezes through the narrow crack at the bottom. You yank the door open and follow.
  </p>
  <p>
    Outside, the hallway stretches ahead. Lockers, coats, and lunch smells. Where did he go?
  </p>

  <span class="step-marker">🎯</span>
  <p>
    You dive once more, arms stretched wide. This time, you're ready. You trap him gently against the floor using your sweater, scooping him up safely inside it.
  </p>
  <p>
    The classroom erupts into applause! Even Mr. Lennox gives a tired but grateful thumbs up.

<article id="cafeteria" class="story-step">
  <span class="step-marker">🍽️</span>
  <p>
    The cafeteria is a war zone of smells and clattering trays. You spot the hamster weaving between tables and backpacks.
  </p>
  <p>
    Miss Jenna, the lunch lady, shrieks as he nearly runs across the dessert counter. "Is that a RAT?!" she yells. Chaos erupts.

  </ul>
</article>

<article id="shortcut" class="story-step">
  <span class="step-marker">🗺️</span>
  <p>
    Thinking fast, you take the shortcut through the art room. You dodge paint buckets and easels, making it to the other cafeteria entrance just as the hamster barrels through.
  </p>
  <p>
    Perfect! You crouch low, ready to intercept.
  </p>
  <ul class="choices">

  <span class="step-marker">🛏️</span>
  <p>
    You pile towels into a soft little nest near the lockers and sprinkle a few cracker crumbs inside.
  </p>
  <p>
    The hamster, curious, sniffs his way over. With a little happy hop, he burrows deep into the pile. You gently fold the towels around him, creating a cozy, portable hamster burrito.

    <li><a href="#nurse-office">Bring him to the nurse's office 🚑</a></li>

  </ul>
</article>

<article id="locker-hide" class="story-step">
  <span class="step-marker">👀</span>
  <p>
    You hide behind the lockers, holding your breath. Sure enough, the hamster comes sniffing along, looking for safety.
  </p>
  <p>
    You pounce — carefully — and catch him with both hands! He looks up at you, tiny nose twitching, and doesn't even try to wriggle away.
